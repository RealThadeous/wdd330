GRANT BOREHAM WDD330 WEEK 1 NOTES

Monday 3 January: Time Spent - 4 hours
-I have a new laptop so I installed VS Code and a few extensions.
-Installed git in vs code (this took over an hour as I was having issues, but eventually got it to work)
-Read through the Orientation and Readings Modules.
-Read the Syllabus but could not purchase the premium account for Site Point through BYU-I BookStore (waiting for feedback on the issue)
-Reading through the Portfolio section and creating my portfolio for Week 1


Tuesday 4 January:
Doing Stuff with Web Things
-Sanboxing(testing) is the best approach when creating developing something new.
-Four steps to developing: Think, Design, Test, and Create
-Think: What is the outcome? Do I have the skills needed or where can I get the knowledge/skills?
-Design: How should it behave/look/feel? How should it interact with other hardware/software?
-Test: What standards should it meet? User Interaction Testing, Unit Testing, Component Testing, System testing, and Installation testing
 If you are unsure about what data the system should send back or the desired outcome for the testing then you have not completed steps Think and/or Design correctly
-Create: You will notice weaknesses in your design and testing, do not throw away and start again, but modify steps 1-3.
 DO NOT USE THE 'THINK LAST' APPROACH! This leads to software shipping late, over budget, and features missing or wrong altogether.
-Purpose of html, CSS, and JS:
 HTML - Define what is shown to the User
 CSS - Make the content pleasant to see
 JS - make the UX interactive instead of passive

Thursday 6 January:
-Continued on with the "Doing Stuff with Web Things" book and completed the first_event exercises.
-When dealing with user input, use the ".value" string
-When showing an output to the user, use the ".innerHTML" string 
-localStorage uses key-value pairs. The key with an associated value.
-Worked on story_editor exercise for about an hour, but couldn't get the "find and edit" button to work

Friday 7 January:
-Completed the story_editor exercise, some code misspelled
-Completed setting up portfolio for week 1
-Watched the first video of the Mobile UX course on SitePoint. Can't watch any more as I'm waiting for my site point link from BYU-I store
    -Design sites for mobile first
    -Start with the lowest device in mind and then your design will be simple and beautiful

QUESTIONS:
-In the first_event exercise we use "(this)" in the JS Code and also the function "(thisButtonClicked)" - this is still confusing to me as I don't see how they relate to the html code?
